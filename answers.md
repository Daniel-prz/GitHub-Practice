1. Why is source control, especially Git, important for software development? Explain the problems that source control systems like Git help solve and the benefits they offer.

Source control, especially Git/GitHub, is great for a number of reason, including tracking bugs and debugging/problem solving, which can be useful for future reference, and can be seen by possible employers as a reflection of your capabilties and track record with coding.

2. How do local and remote repositories differ, and why is synchronization between them essential when working with Git? Provide a clear understanding of these two aspects of Git.

A remote repository is a remote storage of code you can potenitally access on your computer.
A local repository is locally downloaded storage of code unique to your computer.
One can download and 'fork' a remote repository to potentially make and changes and use various commands.
One can also commit changes to a remote repository and 'pull' the changes to a local repository.
